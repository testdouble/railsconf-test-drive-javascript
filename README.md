#Test Double TDD + Angular Workshop

## Why You Should Care

JavaScript gives you superpowers. If you already know Rails, then familiarity with JavaScript and a framework like Angular or Ember acts as a force multiplier. According to Hired.com's RailsConf program insert,

>Ruby engineers that know Angularjs get **20%** more interview requests.

More importantly, this stuff can be super fun.

## Overview

1. [Read Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/theotherzach/test-drive-a-browser-game-with-angularjs)
2. Start with EITHER lineman_start or static_start. Use the static project if you're interested in JavaScript and don't care about modern tooling. Otherwise use Lineman. (Details in setup below.)
3. Follow steps outlined in the deck. They're very rough as they were meant to be used as we were following along in the workshop. Email zach@testdouble.com if you would like more detail. If I don't get emails, I won't worry about outlining them in greater detail.
4. Cheat by looking at EITHER 02a_lineman_finish or 02b_static_finish.

## Setup

### With Internet Access

1. Clone this repo: `git@github.com:testdouble/railsconf-test-drive-javascript.git`
* Install [node](http://nodejs.org/download/)
* Install [lineman](http://linemanjs.com/) by running `nom install -g lineman`
* Open 2 terminal tabs and cd into the project's `lineman_start` directory
* In tab 1, run `lineman run`
* In tab 2, run `lineman spec`
* In your browser, go to `[http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)

### Without Internet Access
1.  Copy the project from a provided USB stick to where you put code
* `cd static_start`
* `open index.html`

## Building Battleship
![Mockup](/mockup.png?raw=true)

MVP:
* Single grid, single player game
* User fires blindly until they sink all opponent ships
* The player doesn't have ships of their own

Bonus:
* Randomize opponent ship positions
* Let the player know when they sink a ship
* Give the player ships and make an AI opponent that can fire back

## Research

From the wikipedia Battleship [page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)):

>After the ships have been positioned, the game proceeds in a series of rounds. In each round, each player takes a turn to announce a target square in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at. The opponent announces whether or not the square is occupied by a ship, and if it is a "hit" they mark this on their own primary grid. The attacking player notes the hit or miss on their own "tracking" grid, in order to build up a picture of the opponent's fleet.
When all of the squares of a ship have been hit, the ship is sunk, and the ship's owner announces this (e.g. "You sank my battleship!"). If all of a player's ships have been sunk, the game is over and their opponent wins.
